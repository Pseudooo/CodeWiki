			<!-- THIS IS THE GENERAL PARAGRAPH -->
			<h3>General</h3>
			<p>When making applications we need to have some degree of interaction with the user and one method of getting this
			interaction is to handle inputs and outputs within your program.</p>

			<!-- THIS IS THE PRINTING PARAGRAPH -->
			<h3>Printing</h3>
			<p>When we need the user that's using the terminal of our program we can make use of the ability to print strings to
			our console. The syntax in Java is like so:</p>

			<!-- Image of sysoutln -->
			<img src="img/Java/SystemPrintlnSyntax.png" width="auto" height="20px">

			<p>In doing this we've gained the ability to output messages to our console! On its own however this is a very restrictive
			feature and doesn't give a lot of merit to our application. Once we gain the ability to take inputs our programs can become
			much more complex and interactive!</p>
			<p>It should be noted that the bit that's being printed, in this case Hello!, is a string which is why it's encased within
			speechmarks.</p>
			<p>If you don't want a new line to be placed automatically at the end of your print statement but instead have the next print
			to follow onto the same line then the following style of print can be used:</p>

			<!-- Image of sysout -->
			<img src="img/Java/SystemPrintSyntax.png" width="auto" height="20px">
			<p>We can combine these sometimes in order to format strings together, so if we were to run the following piece of code within
			our program:</p>

			<!-- Image of sysout and sysoutln example -->
			<img src="img/Java/PrintExampleInputsOutputs.png" width="auto" height="50px">
			<p>Which would produce the following output: </p>
<pre><code>
This is line 1! This is still line 1!
This is line 2!
</code></pre>

			<!-- THIS IS THE INPUTS PARAGRAPH -->
			<h3>Inputs</h3>
			<p>In order to make our ability to print more useful we can make use of the Scanner in Java to ask the user to enter details.
			However the scanner takes a little bit more work, programmatically, to setup.</p>
			<p>So if we want to create a Scanner that we can use within our program that will take inputs from the console. The syntax to
			do this is as follows:</p>
			<img src="img/Java/CreateTerminalScannerSyntax.png" width="auto" height="20px">
			<p>The above line has created a scanner object that is called "sc" and is setup to take inputs from the terminal. This is declared
			by placing "System.in" within the parethesis.</p>
			<p>Now that the scanner object has been created we're free to use it! So if we wanted to make a simple application that would
			ask the user for their name and then print their name back to them we could use the following code:</p>
			<img src="img/Java/GettingUsersNameExample.png" width="auto" height="50px">
			<p>Line 1 would create the scanner item, sc, that's setup to read the inputs from the terminal of the prgram as previously
			mentioned.</p>
			<p>Line 2 creates a variable of type string (<i>Don't worry about variables too much, they're covered in <a href="variables.html">variables</a></i>)
			which is stored by the value of sc.next(). sc.next() essentially pauses the program until the user pushes the enter key into the terminal
			and then returns the value of what's entered by them.</p>
			<p>Line 3 then prints a combination of the string Hello, and adds the name variable we previously declared on the end. So if I were
			to run this program it wouldn't do anything initially and I'd be presented with a blank terminal. This is because we're currently at the
			pause on line 2 where the program is waiting for the user to enter some piece of data. If I then enter my name, Mitchell, it will print the
			following text:</p>
<pre><code>
Hello, Mitchell
</code></pre>

			<!-- Using prints to make prompts-->
			<h3>Prompting Inputs</h3>
			<p>When we used the scanner on its own to collect a single input from the user it wasn't very user friendly. It just presented us with
			a blank screen and we were expected to know what to do. So what if we wanted to modify the program above so that the user is prompted to
			enter their name, we're able to do this by using the print statement.</p>
			<p>If we add the following line of code above our previous code:</p>
			<img src="img/Java/SystemPrintPromptExample.png" width="auto" height="20px">
			<p>Then instead of simply having a blank screen where we're expected to enter our name a piece of text will appear saying Please enter your name:
			and when we start typing it'll appear after the colon. Which is a much more user friendly way to do things as the user isn't expected to
			know what to do instinctively.</p>
